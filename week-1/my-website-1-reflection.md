## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


####**My Reflection**
I've always found it easiest to explain technical tasks to non-technical people by writing out instructions, step by step, as simply as possible. For these steps, I am going to assume that the person already has a GitHub account, and that Git has already been installed on their system. 

######Steps: 

1) Log in to your GitHub account at www.github.com

2) Click on the + at the top right of the screen and select "New repository"

3) Give the Repository a name in the "Repository Name" field

4) Keep "Public selected"

5) Click the "Add a License" box and select "MIT License"

6) Click "Create Repository"

7) On the Repository page, look for the text "HTTPS Clone URL" on the right side of the screen

8) Select the Text in the box below it, and then hit Command+C

9) Open your Terminal by pressing Command+Space and typing Terminal; then hit Enter

10) [Assuming they are using Documents as their Repository] Type *cd documents* and then hit enter

11) Type *git clone CMD+V* and then hit enter

12) When prompted, enter your user name and password

Congratulations! You've now got a repository!

####**Open Source**
Open Source simply means that the Source Code for a program is made available. In commercial software, the software is normally only distributed after it has already been compiled. Open Source means that the code that would compile into the program is what is provided - this way, users can look through the code and see what they are actually installing. 

I feel like Open Source is a mixed bag - I can see both upsides and downsides. It would work well for some projects, but not others. 

For starters, I do not see it working well for commercial products - Photoshop was used as an example. This would also apply to video games, apps, etc. Basically, anything where a company is trying to provide a 'set' experience of product, open source would not work well for. Companies that employ large amounts of full time employees need to be able to recoup their expenses, and continue to pay their employees - if everyone can get the software for free via open source, this becomes much harder to do. 

Another downside I can see is the 'ego'. If I create something incredibly cool - but also a but clunky - and try to monetize it with advertisements, but also make it open source, I run a pretty big risk. Someone could take the source, fix the clunkyness that I never could, and the users would switch to the new platform. This would hurt on both the monetary level, and the "I made something cool, but someone else bested me" ego factor. 

On the upside, I can see open source working really well for non-commercial projects. Projects where the source being publically available doesn't harm anyone's bottom line. It lets large groups of people colloborate on creating an untold amount of content, and then merging the best and brightest ideas into one amazing program. 

It's also great for learning. If I see something that piques my curiosity in an open source program, I can get the source and look at how they did it. I can read source code from the masters to try to get a better understanding of how they think - of how I can improve myself. 

Licenses can help alleviate some of the above issues with Open Source. Depending on the license you use, you retain a certain subset of rights over your code. You can use a license that will require that forked versions of your code still recognize you, or use a license that would forbid others from profiting off your work - or even a license that says anyone is free to do whatever they want with it. 

Licenses seem like a pretty important choice somewhere down the line, although at this point I'm not particularly worried about which license to use as I don't think anyone will be using any of my ideas for a profit... yet. Once I've learned a lot more, I'm sure I'll be spending a lot more time going over the licenses, deciding on open source or closed source, and so on. For now though, I'm just going to focus on learning as much as I can so that my ideas will be worth licensing some day.
